/* tracker.js: a thin wrapper around MediaPipe Tasks Vision.

 *   2. we expose one simple call, `track(video, timestampMs)`, that returns

 * To use a different body part, add a case to createTracker() below.

 * Build a landmark tracker.

 * @param {object} options  passed through to MediaPipe, e.g. { numHands: 2 }
 * @returns {Promise<{kind:string, numLandmarks:number, track:Function, close:Function}>}
 *
 * The returned `track(video, tMs)` gives you:
 *   {
 *     landmarks:      [[{x,y,z}, ...21], ...]   image coords, 0..1, for drawing
 *     worldLandmarks: [[{x,y,z}, ...21], ...]   metres, origin at hand center,
 *                                               use these for real measurements
 *     handedness:     ["Left"|"Right", ...]     (hand tracker only)
 *     handednessScore:[0..1 | null, ...]        how sure it is of each label
 *   }
 * A NOTE ABOUT `handedness`: measured on this platform's UNMIRRORED camera
 * image (research/live/REPORT.md section 1), a physical RIGHT hand is reported
 * "Right" (a mirrored/hflipped frame reports the opposite). It is passed on
 * and saved exactly as reported rather than corrected, so that code which works
 * the hand out from the geometry -- which needs no assumption about mirroring,
 * and stays right even when the label flips at frame edges -- has something
 * independent to check itself against.
 * Each outer array has one entry per detected hand/person. It is EMPTY when
 * nothing was detected in that frame, always check `.landmarks.length`.
